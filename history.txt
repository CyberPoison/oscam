6ffba [dvbapi] Stream type identification defaults to "audio" now On some powervu channels starting a recording resulted in audio not being descrambled. This is a quick fix, until a better solution is found.
d34f5 [dvbapi] Limit the number of streams descrambled on extended cw Descrambling is now limited to 4 audio streams (there are no more than 4 audio streams in powervu channels anyway) and disabled completely for data/subtitle streams as there appear to be un-encrypted in every powervu channel. This saves CA indices and allows for more channels to be descrambled simultaneously (e.g. when doing recordings).
e7888 [makefile] Fixed linking of empty SoftCam.Key file on aarch64 boxes

f8aa1 [streamserver] Fixed small bug in packet reading
0b6cb [osemu] Add RossCrypt1 as supported caid This is not a functional change, as it works without this also. This is needed just to stop the "decoding is waiting for matching readers" message in the livelog.

9bd26 [streamserver] Changed variable name To match the naming used in the specification
0f94d [streamserver] Added support for Compel encryption system This unconventional encryption system (data are XOR-ed with a dynamic key) works only via the Stream Relay option. Refer to the wiki for more information on how to configure OSCam-Emu for use with Compel.
bc4cb - fix for ticket #4699 - add tandberg to 'get cardsysten' in oscam.simples.c - fix for ticket #4700 - add #include <sys/sysmacros.h> to globals.h
cbeaf [streamserver] Added "Caid" setting in the stream relay configuration From now on the stream relay accepts a caid setting via the webif. The relay will be enabled only for the caid(s) specified. Channels with caids other than those specified in this setting will be descrambled via the dvb-api. An empty setting means the stream relay will be not used at all.
